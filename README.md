# Advent of Code 2024 - Typescript

In this project I will solve a couple of the advent of code challenges using Typescript.

## Install

```
npm i
```

## Compile 

This will compile the typescript files to javascript on every file change.

```

```

## Run

Execute the compiled files using node.

```
